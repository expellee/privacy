        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Magnet Brothers</strong> (hereinafter referred to as the "Operator") establishes and discloses the following privacy policy in accordance with Article 30 of the Personal Information Protection Act to protect the personal information of data subjects and to handle related grievances promptly and smoothly.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Purpose of Processing Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            Folders Camera (hereinafter referred to as the "App") processes the minimum amount of personal information and device permissions for the following purposes. The personal information being processed will not be used for purposes other than the following, and if the purpose of use changes, necessary measures such as obtaining separate consent will be implemented.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Photo and Video Recording:</strong> Providing camera functions to save photos/videos directly to a folder selected by the user.
            </li>
            <li><strong>File Management and Storage:</strong> Providing functions for folder creation, file moving, deletion, and album management within the device.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Services:</strong> Controlling access to specific folders via password settings and protecting privacy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Items of Personal Information Processed and Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            The App requests the following device permissions to provide services. These permissions are essential to perform the core functions of the App.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Used for taking photos and videos.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Storage (Media File Access):</strong> Used to save captured results in specific folders and manage (move/delete) existing files.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Password:</strong> The password set by the user for the folder lock function is <strong>encrypted using SHA-256</strong> and safely stored within the device. The Operator does not collect it or transmit it to a server.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Processing and Retention Period of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            This App <strong>does not store or collect</strong> the user's photos, videos, or password data <strong>on external servers</strong>. All data is stored only within the user's device, and if the App is deleted or if the user manually deletes the data, the Operator cannot recover it.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Provision of Personal Information to Third Parties</h2>
        <p>
            The Operator does not provide the user's personal information to third parties. All shooting data and management information are processed only within the user's device.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Measures to Ensure Safety of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>The Operator takes the following technical measures to protect the user's privacy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Encryption:</strong> Passwords set by the user are stored after passing through a standard encryption algorithm (SHA-256), so the original password remains protected even in case of external leakage.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Local Processing:</strong> All photo organization and folder management processes occur offline within the device.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Rights and Obligations of Data Subjects and Legal Representatives and How to Exercise Them</h2>
        <p>
            Users can stop data processing at any time by revoking granted permissions through app settings or by deleting the App. Photos and folders stored in the device can be directly deleted at any time through the device's file management system.
        </p>
